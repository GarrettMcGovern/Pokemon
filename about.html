    <h3>About</h3> 
		<p> This website was created for a school project for a web development class.
			The purpose was to learn how to use html, CSS and JavaScript to create an application that 
			I would use to keep track of information and to showcase what the different forms of Pokemon look 
			like. 
	<h3>Credits</h3> 
		<p>The IP of Pokemon is owned by the <b><a href = "https://www.pokemon.com/us">Pokemon 
		company.</b></a> The images are all sprites of Pokemon that were all taken from the website 
		<b><a href = "https://pokemondb.net">Pokemon Database.</a></b> The sprites are used under a fair use 
		policy, and were free to use.
